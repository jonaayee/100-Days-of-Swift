// Swift is a type-safe language, which means each variable has a type (can be automatically assigned)

var greeting = "Hello, playground" // string
var age: Int = 18 // integer (whole number)

// underscores act as commas
var population = 8_000_000

// Swift will not compile if a variable switches types
